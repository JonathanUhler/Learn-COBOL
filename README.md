# Learn-COBOL
This is an archive for COBOL test projects written to understand and learn the language. 
The programs focus on different important aspects of programming and build on one-another to enhance my skills over time.

The programs scale in difficulty with HELLO-WORLD.cbl being the simplest and BANK.cbl being the most complex

The projects were written using OpenCobolIDE (formerly GNU Cobol)
